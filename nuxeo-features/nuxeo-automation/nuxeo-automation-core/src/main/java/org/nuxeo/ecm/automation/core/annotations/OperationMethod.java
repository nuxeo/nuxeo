/**
 * To be used to mark methods provided by an operation. A method must have at most one argument which is the operation
 * input and a return type which is the operation output. Methods with zero parameters (void input) will match any
 * input. An operation may have multiple methods if it supports multiple input and output types.
 * <p>
 * For each INPUT/OUTPUT type association you must create a new method in an operation and annotate it using this
 * annotation. The set of input types available in an operation are the operation accepted types and the set of output
 * types are the operation produced types. A produced type will become the input type for the next operation in the
 * chain, that will be dispatched to the right method that know how to consume the type.
 * <p>
 * When an operation provides 2 methods accepting the same input type the chain will need to take a decision to
 * determine the best way to continue. A common algorithm to find the right path until the end of the chain is
 * backtracking: from a set of potential nodes one is selected to be visited (randomly or not). If the node is a dead
 * end then another node from the set is taken until the path to the last node is created.
 * <p>
 * A chain may have no paths until the last operation. In this case the chain is invalid and the chain processor will
 * trigger an error. Also, a chain can provide multiple paths to the last operation. To help the engine to find the best
 * path until the last operation you can use the {@link #priority()} attribute to specify which method is preferred. The
 * default priority is 0 (e.g. no priority). Higher priorities have more chance to be selected when a conflict occurs.
 * If no user priority is specified (i.e. priority is 0) then the default priority is used. Here is how the default
 * priority is computed (the top most case has the greater priority):
 * <ul>
 * <li>The input type is an exact match of the method declared argument
 * <li>The method argument type is assignable from the input type (i.e. a super type but not an exact match)
 * <li>The input can be adapted to the method argument using registered type adapters
 * <li>the method has no arguments (void input)
 * </ul>
 * If no one of these rules applies then the method will not match the input.
 * <p>
 * The class owning the annotated method must be annotated using {@link Operation}
