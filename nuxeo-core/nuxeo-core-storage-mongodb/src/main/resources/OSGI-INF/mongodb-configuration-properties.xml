      Property to disable the fact that on MongoDB a LIKE match anchors its search
      (like in SQL databases), i.e., absent wildcards, it does not match in the middle of a string.

      When true, does not match in the middle of a string.
      When false, works as if there was a % on each side of the LIKE expression.

      @since 10.3
