      Property that allows to not set the files count on the extra field of the zip file produced by NuxeoArchiveWriter.
      This may be interesting if the archive would be opened by external software that doesn't support the produced
      zip, such as Archive Utility on MacOS.
      Performance could be impacted when reading an archive without this extra information.
