/**
 * A {@link Work} instance gets scheduled and executed by a {@link WorkManager} .
 * <p>
 * Its {@link #work} method runs when a slot in a queue becomes available, note however that it can be suspended at any
 * time (before initial execution, or during execution).
 * <p>
 * A {@link Work} instance has an id that is used by the queuing mechanisms to determine uniqueness. It also has a
 * category that is used to choose which queue should execute it. It can report its status and progress.
 * <p>
 * A {@link Work} instance is Serializable because it must be able to save its computation state on interruption, and be
 * reconstructed again with the saved state to continue execution at a later time. Because of this, the instance itself
 * may change over time and be executed on a different JVM than the one that constructed it initially.
 * <p>
 * A {@link Work} instance must have an id, which is used for equality comparisons and as a key for persistent queues.
 * <p>
 * Implementors are strongly advised to inherit from {@link AbstractWork}.
