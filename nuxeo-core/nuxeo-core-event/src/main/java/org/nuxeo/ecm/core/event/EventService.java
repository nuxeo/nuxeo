/**
 * The event service manages listener registries and notifies listeners about core events.
 * <p>
 * The service is able to run in a transactional mode where all events are recorded and fired after the transaction
 * commits in one step as an event bundle.
 * <p>
 * To start a transaction, the framework calls the {@link #transactionStarted()} method, and at transaction commit the
 * framework calls {@link #transactionCommitted()} to fire the event bundle. Upon rollback the framework calls
 * {@link #transactionRolledback()} to clean up recorded events.
 * <p>
 * Events are recorded in a thread variable so they are valid only in the current thread.
 * <p>
 * An event marked {@link Event#isInline()} is dispatched immediately, otherwise it is recorded in a thread-based bundle
 * of current events. If no transaction was started, an event marked {@link Event#isCommitEvent()} is used to flush the
 * event bundle to its listeners, otherwise the transaction commit does the flush.
 * <p>
 * Listeners are of two types: {@link EventListener} notified as the event is raised and {@link PostCommitEventListener}
 * notified after the transaction was committed.
