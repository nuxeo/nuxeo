/**
 * Document properties are instances of document schema fields.
 * <p>
 * You can say that a {@link Field} object is like a Java class and a Property object like a class instance. Thus,
 * schemas defines fields (or elements) which have a name and a type, and each field of a document can be instantiated
 * (if the schema permits) as a Property object.
 * <p>
 * Properties are always bound to a schema field that provides the type and constraints on the property values. An
 * exception is the root property the {@link DocumentPart} object which is not bound to a field but to a schema.
 * <p>
 * So properties are holding the actual values for each defined field.
 * <p>
 * The usual way of using properties is to get a document from the storage server then modify document properties and
 * send them back to the storage server to that modifications are be stored.
 * <p>
 * Note that the storage server can be on a remote machine so when modifying properties remotely they are serialized and
 * sent through the network between the two machines. This means properties must hold serializable values and also they
 * must store some state flags so that the storage can decide which property was modified and how in order to correctly
 * update the stored versions.
 * <p>
 * As we have seen each property may hold a serializable value which we will refer to as the <code>normalized</code>
 * property value. For each schema field type there is only one java serializable object representation that will be
 * used as the normalized value. The property API is giving you the possibility to use different compatible objects when
 * setting or getting property values. Each property implementation will automatically convert the given value into a
 * normalized one; so internally only the normalized value is stored.
 * <p>
 * For example, for date properties you may use either <code>Date</code> or <code>Calendar</code> when setting or
 * retrieving a property value, but the normalized value will be the <code>Calendar</code> one.
 * <p>
 * As we have seen, properties keep some state flags. Property flags can be divided in two groups:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Dirty Flags - that reflect the public status of the document
 * <li>Internal Flags - that reflect some internal state
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Property Types:
 * <p>
 * Before going deeper in property flags, we will talk first about property types. There are several types of properties
 * that are very closed on the type of fields they are bound onto.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Root Property (or <code>DocumentPart</code>) - this is a special property that is bound to a schema instead of a
 * field And it is the root of the property tree.
 * <li>Complex Properties - container properties that are bound to complex field types that can be represented as java
 * <code>Map</code> objects. These properties contains a set of schema defined properties. You cannot add new child
 * properties. You can only modify existing child properties. Complex property values are expressed as java
 * <code>Map</code> objects.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Structured Properties - this is a special case of complex properties. The difference is that structured property
 * values are expressed as <i>scalar</i> java objects instead of java maps. By scalar java objects we mean any well
 * structured object which is not a container like a <code>Map</code> or a <code>Collection</code>. These objects are
 * usually as scalar values - it doesn't make sense for example to set only some parts of that objects without creating
 * the object completely. An example of usage are Blob properties that use {@link Blob} values.
 * </ul>
 * <li>List Properties - container properties that are bound to list field types.
 * <li>Scalar Properties - atomic properties that are bound to scalar field types and that are using as values scalar or
 * primitive java objects like arrays, primitives, String, Date etc.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * As we've seen there are 2 categories of properties: container properties and scalar properties Complex and list
 * properties are container properties while structured and scalar properties are scalar.
 * <p>
 * Dirty Flags:
 * <p>
 * Dirty flags are used to keep track of the dirty state of a property. The following flags are supported:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>IS_PHANTOM</code> - whether the property is existing in the storage (was explicitly set by the user) or it
 * was dynamically generated using the default value by the implementation to fulfill schema definition. This applies to
 * all property types
 * <li><code>IS_MODIFIED</code> - whether the property value was modified. This applies to all property types.
 * <li><code>IS_NEW</code> - whether the property is a new property that was added to a parent list property This
 * applies only to properties that are children of a list property.
 * <li><code>IS_REMOVED</code> - whether a property was removed. A removed property will be removed from the storage and
 * the next time you access the property it will be a <code>phantom</code> one. This applies only to properties that are
 * children of a complex property.
 * <li><code>IS_MOVED</code> - whether the property was moved on another position inside the container list. This
 * applies only to properties that are children of a list property.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * There are several constraints on how property flags may change. This is a list of all changes that may occur over
 * dirty flags:
 * <ul>
 * <li>NONE + MODIFIED =&gt; MODFIED
 * <li>NONE + REMOVED =&gt; REMOVED
 * <li>NONE + MOVED =&gt; MOVED
 * <li>PHANTOM + MODIFIED =&gt; MODIFIED
 * <li>NEW + MODIFIED =&gt; NEW | MODIFIED
 * <li>NEW + MOVED =&gt; NEW | MOVED
 * <li>MODIFIED + REMOVED =&gt; REMOVED
 * <li>MODIFIED + MOVED =&gt; MODIFIED | MOVED
 * <li>MODIFIED + MODIFIED =&gt; MODIFIED
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The combinations not listed above are not permitted.
 * <p>
 * In case of list items, the REMOVED flag is not used since the property will be physically removed from the property
 * tree.
 * <p>
 * Also when the dirty flag of a children property changes, its parent is informed to update its MODIFIED flag if
 * needed. This way a modification on a children property is propagated to parents in the form of a MODIFIED flag.
 * <p>
 * Internal Flags:
 * <p>
 * Internal flags are used by the implementation to keep some internal state. For these flags you should look into the
 * implementation
 * <p>
 * Apart flags properties can also hold some random user data using {@link Property#setData(Object)} and
 * {@link Property#getData()} methods. This can be used for example to keep a context attached to a property. But be
 * aware when using this you should provide serializable objects as the data you are attaching otherwise if properties
 * are serialized / unserialized this will generate errors. The API is not forcing you to use serializable values since
 * you can also use this feature to store temporary context data that will not be sent over the network.
