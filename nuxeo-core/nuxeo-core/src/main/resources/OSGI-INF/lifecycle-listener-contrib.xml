      Listener for life cycle change events.

      If event occurs on a folder, it will recurse on children to perform the
      same transition if possible.

      If the transition event is about marking documents as "deleted", and a
      child cannot perform the transition, it will be removed.

      Undelete transitions are not recursed on the children, however a special
      documentUndeleted event has the same role and is processed by this listener.
