      Extension point for registering event listeners.

      <p>
        An event listener has the following properties:

        - name: identifier for this listener. It must be unique within the
        application.

        - class: the class to use for this event listener, see below for
        implementation requirements.

        - order: the order in which the listener will be notified of an event.
        This may be useful if different listeners have to react in a specified
        order. If no order is given, order 0 is assumed. Negative orders are
        accepted. Listeners can share the same order, but the notification order
        will not be reliable.

        - eventId: event ids this listener processes. Multiple values can be
        defined. If no eventId attributes are defined, the listener is notified
        for all events. It is then responsible for filtering events it has to
        process in its notifyEvent method.
      </p>

      <p>
        Event listeners must implement the
        org.nuxeo.ecm.core.listener.EventListener interface and will be notified
        on each call back : public void notifyEvent(CoreEvent coreEvent); Core
        Event listeners are synchronous. Thus they should be implemented to
        rather perform non time consuming heavy computing that would decrease
        core txn performances.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nuxeo core defines a default set of event ids that are defined in :
        org.nuxeo.ecm.core.api.event.DocumentEventTypes. Though, you can extend
        them and define your own event ids and listeners reacting on them.

      Core event listener that forwards core events to the nuxeo runtime event
      service.

      Order is set to 10 so that forwarding is done before most of other
      listener operations.
