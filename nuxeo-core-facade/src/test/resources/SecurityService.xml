  <documentation>
    The security service is responsible to check the permission on a
    repository. Permission check will be usually forwarded to the
    security manager defined on the repository. This may change later.
    <p />
    It holds a permission provider that defines the list of available permission
    names and how they are combined into groups of permissions.
    <p />
    It also defines which permissions are high level permissions that are to be
    managed through the end user interface and in which order they should be
    display in management menus.
    <p />
    It also holds a security policy service that can stack custom policies.
    These policies can override default permission checks based on acls set on
    the document and/or its parents.

  <extension-point name="permissions">

    <documentation>
      Extension point to register permission definitions or override
      existing permissions.
      <p />

      Example to define a single atomic permissions that are not meant
      to be displayed in the rights management screen of folders:
      <code>
        <permission name="Browse" />
        <permission name="ReadVersion" />
        <permission name="ReadProperties" />
        <permission name="ReadChildren" />
        <permission name="ReadLifeCycle" />
        <permission name="ReviewParticipant" />
      </code>

      <p />

      Example to define a compound permission that holds many related
      atomic permissions into a single high level (role-like)
      permission:
      <code>
        <permission name="Read">
          <include name="Browse" />
          <include name="ReadVersion" />
          <include name="ReadProperties" />
          <include name="ReadChildren" />
          <include name="ReadLifeCycle" />
          <include name="ReviewParticipant" />
        </permission>
      </code>

      Note that each of the included permissions should have been
      previously registered with their on &lt;permission/&gt;
      declaration.

      <p />

      It is later possible to override that definition in another
      contribution to that extension-point to add a new permission
      'CustomPerm' and remove 'ReviewParticipant':
      <code>
        <permission name="CustomPerm" />

        <permission name="Read">
          <include name="CustomPerm" />
          <remove name="ReviewParticipant" />
        </permission>
      </code>

      <p />

      Eventually the permissions declaration also accept 'alias' tags to
      handle backward compatibility with deprecated permissions:
      <code>
        <permission name="ReadVersion">
          <!-- The Version permission is deprecated
            since it's name is ambiguous, use
            ReadPermission instead -->
          <alias name="Version" />
        </permission>
      </code>

      NB: the alias feature is parsed by the extension point but the
      underlying SecurityManager implementation does not leverage it
      yet.

  </extension-point>

  <extension-point name="permissionsVisibility">

    <documentation>
      Extension point to register permission visibility in user
      interface or override existing settings.
      <p />

      Example to define the default list of permissions that are
      manageable through the UI screens:
      <code>
        <visibility>
          <item show="true" order="10">Read</item>
          <item show="true" order="50">ReadWrite</item>
          <item show="true" order="100">Everything</item>
        </visibility>
      </code>

      This list of options items will be displayed if no type specific
      settings are registered.

      <p />
      Example to define the default list of permissions that are
      specific to the Section document type:
      <code>
        <visibility type="Section">
          <item show="true" order="10">Read</item>
          <item show="true" order="100">Everything</item>
        </visibility>
      </code>

      Note: the 'show' attribute defaults to 'true' and the 'order'
      attribute defaults to '0'.

      class="org.nuxeo.ecm.core.security.PermissionVisibilityDescriptor" />
  </extension-point>

  <extension-point name="policies">

    <documentation>
      Extension point to register custom security policies or override existing
      policies.
      <p />

      Policies are checked in the order they are defined. They can grant or deny
      access, in case following policies - as well as the default security check
      relying on the acp set on the document - will be ignored. They can also
      return an undefined access, in case following policy checks will continue.

      <p />

      Example to define a custom policy :
      <code>
        <policy name="lock"
          class="org.nuxeo.ecm.core.security.LockSecurityPolicy" order="10" />
      </code>

      The class used has to implement the
      org.nuxeo.ecm.core.security.SecurityPolicy interface.

      <p />

      It is later possible to override that definition in another contribution
      to that extension-point to disable or override a policy:
      <code>
        <policy name="lock" enabled="false" />

        <policy name="lock"
          class="org.nuxeo.ecm.core.security.LockSecurityPolicy" order="20" />
      </code>
