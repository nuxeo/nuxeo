# Nuxeo platform 9.10-HF21-SNAPSHOT

Welcome to the Nuxeo Platform 9.10-HF21-SNAPSHOT.

You can always download the latest releases of Nuxeo packages (distributions, 
installers, virtual machine images, ...) from [https://www.nuxeo.com/downloads/][1].
Previous releases are available at [http://nuxeo.github.com/downloads.html][2]

## Requirements

The applications based on the Nuxeo Platform need Java. Please install and set up a
Java Development Kit 8 (JDK 8, also called Java 1.8; JRE is not enough)* if it's not
already installed on your computer.  
* We currently support Oracle's JDK[3] and OpenJDK[4] as a default Java setup. 
Don't hesitate to contact us if you need us to support a JDK from another vendor.

Even if not supported, we welcome your feedback if you encounter any trouble with 
earlier versions of the JDK. Nuxeo won't work with any previous release of Java.

Under Windows, virus scan should be configured to avoid scanning
Nuxeo's installation folder.  See [lock problems leading to server errors][5].

Read the [Installation documentation][34] for more information.

## Getting Started

After you have installed the Nuxeo Platform, either follow the Quick configuration
steps described on the online [Installation Guide][34] or the instructions below:

1. Go to your installation directory.
2. Start the server:
  + under Linux/Unix/MacOS, run "./bin/nuxeoctl start" to use only the terminal 
    or "./bin/nuxeoctl gui start" to display the Control Panel 
    (run "./bin/nuxeoctl help" for list of available commands).
  + under Windows, run "bin\nuxeoctl.bat" (the Control Panel is displayed by default, 
    use "--gui=false" option for terminal only).
  + you can also use a Debian[7] or Windows[8] service.  
3. Point your browser to http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/.
4. Configure your server using the displayed Startup Wizard.
5. Select the addons you want to install on the Platform (a lot of other addons 
   are available on [the Nuxeo Marketplace][10]).
6. When the server is restarted, log in using the "Administrator"
   login and the "Administrator" password (no quotes, of course, but
   capital "A").

For complete setup and configuration, you should refer to the [Administration pages of
the documentation][11].
