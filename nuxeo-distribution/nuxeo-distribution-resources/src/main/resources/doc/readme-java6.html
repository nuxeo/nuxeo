<h1>Running Nuxeo DM with Java 6</h1>

<p>Nuxeo DM has been compiled against Java 5 but is runnable with Java Runtime Environment 6 (this is actually the recommended version).</p>

<p>When running under Java 6, the startup script applies some fixes, 
moving for example the scripting API out of the classpath (as it's already provided by Java6).</p>

<h1>Building Nuxeo DM</h1>

<p>The JDK 5 compiled binary is our primary/recommended binary distribution. 
It has undergone rigorous testing and can run under both a Java 5 or a Java 6 JRE/JDK.</p>

<p>However, you can build with Sun JDK 6 and then run under JRE/JDK 6 only.</p>

<h1>Details for experts</h1>

<p>If you encounter problems using JBoss with a Sun Java 6 runtime, you may
want to set -Dsun.lang.ClassLoader.allowArraySyntax=true, as described in
JBAS-4491. Other potential problems under a Java 6 runtime include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>ORB getting prematurely destroyed when using Sun JDK 6 (see Sun Bug
    ID:6520484)</li>
    <li>Unimplemented methods in Hibernate for JDK6 interfaces.</li>
</ul>

<p>When JBossAS 4.2.3 is compiled with Java 6, support for the extended JDBC
4 API is included in the binary, however this can only be used under a Java 6
runtime. In this case no manual configuration steps are necessary. It should be
noted however that the Java 6 compiled distribution of JBoss AS 4.2.3.GA is
still in experimental stage.</p>
