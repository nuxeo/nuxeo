# Nuxeo Platform Smart Search

Addon adding UI features to build a query, and save it in a document.

The modules nuxeo-platform-smart-query* are in charge of the query build,
they add a "Smart search" item on the main Search tab default searches,
that makes it possible to build a query and see its results.

The modules nuxeo-platform-smart-folder-* add features to save the search in
a document model of type "smart folder". This document type can also be
created as other documents. It presents the search results on its view tab,
and a form similar to the smart search form on its edit tab and creation
page.
