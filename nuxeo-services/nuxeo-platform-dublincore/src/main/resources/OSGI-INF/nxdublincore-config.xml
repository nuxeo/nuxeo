      Property that defines whether the dublincore-related listener that sets
      the creator and creation date is executed in event "aboutToCreate" or "documentCreated".

      If false, it's done in event "documentCreated" which is compatible with previous behavior but prevents
      the first version of auto-versioned documents from getting a proper creator and creation date.

      If true, it's done in event "aboutToCreate", which corrects the behavior.
