# Nuxeo Platform Signature


This is a digital signature plugin for signing PDF files. It provides multiple functionalities related to digital signing of documents, among others:

1. to create user certificates and store them within the Nuxeo CAP Instance.
2. to sign pdf documents
3. to share/download the local root certificate used for signing all documents within the domain

## Building and deploying

To see the list of all commands available for building and deploying, use the following:

    $ ant usage

### How to build

You can build Nuxeo Digital Signature plugin with:

    $ ant build

If you want to build and launch the tests, do it with:

    $ ant build-with-tests

### How to deploy

Configure the build.properties files (starting from the `build.properties.sample` file to be found in the current folder), to point your Tomcat instance:

    $ cp build.properties.sample build.properties
    $ vi build.properties

You can then deploy Nuxeo Digital Signature to your Tomcat instance with:

    $ ant deploy-tomcat

You can also take all generated jar files (currently 3, present in the target directories of all submodules of this project), copy them into `$NUXEO_HOME/templates/custom/bundles/` and activate the "custom" template.


## Project Structure

This project can be divided conceptually into 3 parts:

1) certificate generation (low-level PKI object operations, CA operations)

2) certificate persistence (storing and retrieving keystores containing certificates inside nuxeo directories)

3) pdf signing with an existing certificate


## Configuration:

1) Install your root keystore file in a secured directory

To do initial testing you can use the keystore specified in:
./nuxeo-platform-signature-core/src/main/resources/OSGI-INF/root-contrib.xml

2) You might have to modify your server system's java encryption configuration by installing JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files needed for passwords longer than 7 characters,

*Note: cryptography exportation laws differ between countries so make sure you are using adequate encryption configuration, libraries and tools.*
