# Nuxeo Quota

Nuxeo Quota module.

## About this module

This module provides a pluggable infrastructure to be able to collect some real time statistics about content in the repository and enforce rules (like Quota).

### Principles

The QuotaStatsService service provides an extension point to register QuotaStatsUpdater that will be responsible for computing the statistics.
The QuotaStatsUpdater will be called:

 - via a Synchronous Event Listener
 - in batch mode for initial computation

The batch mode is triggered via the Admin Center.

### Default contributions

There are 2 default contributions to QuotaStatsService:

#### documentsCountUpdater

Counts the number non folderish objects and maintain the total number on the parent.
Count data is stored in a documents_count_statistics.xsd schema that is automatically added to each folderish document during computation.

#### documentsSizeUpdater

Computes Blob size on each item in the content tree.
Each content item in the tree will have an additional schema documents_size_statistics.xsd that contains:

 - the inner size of the object (innerSize): size of all the blobs in this document (in bytes)
 - the total size of the object (totalSize): inner size + size of all the children (in bytes)
 - the allowed maximum total size (maxSize): maximum quota

If the maxSize is set to -1, then no quota check is performed, otherwise maxSize enforcement is done synchronously.

documentsSizeUpdater works in a 2 phases manner:

 - synchronously : check what has changed in the document and checks quota
 - asynchronously : update counters on item and all parents

The synchronous execution that checks Quota will rollback the transaction and raise a QuotaExceededException if the current transaction would break the quota rule.

The current implementation of documentSizeUpdater:

 - handles checks create / update / delete / move / copy
 - takes into accounts the versions (Document with 2 versions will have a total size of inner size + size of the versions).

## Automation API

2 Automation Operations are defined to be able to remotely manage the Quota on a given Document:

 - Quotas.GetInfo: to retrieve informations about the Quota Info of a Document (innerSize, totalSize and maxSize)
 - Quotas.SetMaxSize: to define the maximum size allowed in a given Document

# Building

    mvn clean install

## Deploying

Install [the Nuxeo Quota Marketplace Package](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/package/nuxeo-quota).
Or manually copy the built artifacts into `$NUXEO_HOME/templates/custom/bundles/` and activate the "custom" template.
