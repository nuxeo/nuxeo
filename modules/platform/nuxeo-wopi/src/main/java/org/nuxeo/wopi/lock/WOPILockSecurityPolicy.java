 * <p>
 * Unlike the standard {@link LockSecurityPolicy}, even if the document is locked by someone else, the WRITE permission
 * is not blocked if a WOPI lock exists for the document and the request originated from a WOPI client.
 * <p>
 * This handles the case of multiple users editing a document at the same time in Office Online, which is considered by
 * the Nuxeo WOPI host as a single WOPI client.
