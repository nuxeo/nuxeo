    This component provides a service for notifications.

    By registering with this extension point one can specify the possible
    notifications to which a user can subscribe, or to which a user is
    automatically subscribed.
  </documentation>
  <extension-point name="notifications">
    <documentation>
      This extension point can be used to configure available notifications. A
      given notification has the form:
      <code>
        <notification name="Publication" channel="email"
          availableIn="Section, Workspace" autoSubscribed="false"
          template="publishContent">
          <event name="sectionContentPublished" />
          <event name="myContentPublished" />
        </notification>
      </code>
      The
      <em>name</em>
      is the identifier for this notification.

      The
      <em>channel</em>
      is always "email".

      The
      <em>autoSubscribed</em>
      flag can be true if this notification is aways taken into account, or
      false if you want to allow users to enable/disable this notification by
      themselves.

      The
      <em>template</em>
      refers to the body template, which can be configured through the
      "templates" extension point.

      The
      <em>availableIn</em>
      attribute specifies in which types of superspaces the notification is
      active, it can be a comma-separated lists of types, or "*" or "all" to
      make the notification active in any container.

      To disable an existing notification:
      <code>
        <notification name="Publication" enabled="false" />
      </code>

    <object
      class="org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.ec.notification.service.NotificationDescriptor" />
    <object
      class="org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.ec.notification.service.NotificationEventDescriptor" />
  </extension-point>

  <extension-point name="templates">
    <documentation>
      This extension point can be used to define templates for notifications.

      By default inside the template files those expressions are available to use:

      ${docId} - the UID of the document that produced the notification

      ${author} - the user name of who or what produced the event

      ${principalAuthor} - the same as ${author}

      ${principalAuthor.firstName} - the first name of ${principalAuthor}
      if defined for the corresponding user

      ${principalAuthor.lastName} - the family name of ${principalAuthor}
      if defined for the corresponding user

      ${dateTime) - date and time when it happened - must be formatted according
      to the freemaker rules

      ${docUrl} - For now it displays the path to follow to get to the document
      that was the source of the event

      ${docTitle} - displays the title of the document that produced the
      notification

      ${newDocUrl} - this can display the path of the document modified/created
      inside the document that produced the notification. This newDoc is the
      child of the producer document.

      ${newDocTitle} - the same that ${newDocUrl}, but displays the title.

      ${newDocId} - the same that ${newDocUrl}, but displays the UID.

      If you need to add some more variables into your templates, just put the
      data you need to display in the notification in the eventInfo map of the
      JMS message that is sent to queue topic/NXPMessages.

      The same goes for subject but in this case there is no need to define a
      template. Just put the string that you need to have as subject and if it
      contains dynamic elements ${XXX}, they will be rendered just like it
      happens in the body.

      For example :

      When creating the message : mesage.getEventInfo().put("docSize",
      sizeOfDocument);

      In your template file : The document has ${docSize}KB.
