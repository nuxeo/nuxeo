# Nuxeo Target Platforms

This module allows to declare definitions of Nuxeo target platforms
and packages.

When these XML contributions are deployed on the service, a tab is
made available in the Admin Center to make it possible to override
some of the target platforms attribute, on a live instance.

It also provides helpers to extend target platforms, packages,
etc.. classes to add specific information to these targets. This is
useful for Connect, IO and Studio features.

## Modules

- nuxeo-target-platforms-api: interfaces and default POJO
  implementations.
- nuxeo-target-platforms-core: runtime service implementation relying
  on XML contributions and service implementation, querying a dedicated
  directory for target platforms attributes override.
- nuxeo-target-platforms-jsf: pages for management of target platforms
  in the Admin Center.
- nuxeo-target-platforms-io: export of target platforms and packages
  information providing Json serialization.
- nuxeo-target-platforms-jaxrs: REST API for Json exports (see below)
- nuxeo-target-platforms-sample: sample contributions to the service.

## Versions

The naming of releases follows the convention: `XX.YY.AABB`, where:
- XX represents the major number of the release.
- YY represents the minor number of the release.
- AA represents the underlying Nuxeo version.
- BB represents the underlying Nuxeo Hot Fix version.

For example, a release which uses Nuxeo `6.0-HF31` will end with `.6031`.

## Build

    $ mvn clean install

## Deploying

Copy the built artifacts into `$NUXEO_HOME/templates/custom/bundles/` and activate the "custom" template.

## Usage

Admin center tab is available at Admin Center > Target Platforms.

## REST API

All calls accept boolean query parameter "pretty" for pretty print of
Json serialization.
