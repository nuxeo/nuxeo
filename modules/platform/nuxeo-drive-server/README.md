# Nuxeo Drive Server

Addon needed for [Nuxeo Drive](https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-drive) to work against a Nuxeo Platform instance.

# Building

    mvn clean install

## Deploying

Install [the Nuxeo Drive Marketplace Package](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/package/nuxeo-drive).
Or manually copy the built artifacts into `$NUXEO_HOME/templates/custom/bundles/` and activate the "custom" template.

You should then have the 'Nuxeo Drive' tab in your Home allowing you to download the Nuxeo Drive client for your favorite OS :-)
