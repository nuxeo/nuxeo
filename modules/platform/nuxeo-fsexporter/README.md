Customizable exporter
# Introduction
This plugin enables the user to export one chosen root structure of documents in Nuxeo to a specified File System repository.

The installation of the plugin will add a new operation in “Services” called “ExportStructureToFS”. This operation must be added to the registries in Studio and then can be used in an automation chain.

# Usage
## Default Behavior
The operation “ExportStructureToFS” has the 3 parameters:
- Root Name: the root name of the structure of Nuxeo Platform that will be exported
- File System Target: where the export will be done on the File System
- Query: optional parameter. By default the query called by the exporter is:

SELECT * FROM Document ecm:mixinType !='HiddenInNavigation' AND ecm:isVersion = 0 AND ecm:isTrashed = 0


## Customization
### Change the default query by retrieving your selection of documents (based on different selected facets or types...)
### Use the extension point "exportLogic" to change the logic of export
A contribution "CustomExporterPlugin" has been implemented as an example: provides the default export + create the XML version
