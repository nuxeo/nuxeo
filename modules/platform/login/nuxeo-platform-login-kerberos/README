Kerberos authenticator for Nuxeo
================================

## BUILDING

Nothing special. All necessary classes are in JDK 6. Simply run:

    mvn clean install

## HOWTO

Here's an How to to help you configure the SPNEGO/Kerberos authentication for Nuxeo. Notice that this it starts with OS relative guidelines.


### Linux ONLY

- first configure Kerberos for your server and client! For example in a Debian-based Linux server install krb5-kdc and krb5-admin-server, and setup a realm (with krb5_newrealm). In a Windows environment you don't have anything to do assuming you already have an Active Directory domain.

- create a service principal and set its service principal name to HTTP/<canonical name of the server>@REALM then export its keytab
In MIT Kerberos, using kadmin, do the following:

add_principal HTTP/servername
(type in a password)

Important: the service principal MUST be uppercase HTTP slash the canonical (DNS-wise) name of the server. Any other names will not work (especially, aliases).

ktadd -k /tmp/keytab HTTP/servername

(you may create as many principals you want and add their keys to the same keytab, e.g. HTTP/nuxeo@COMPANY and HTTP/nuxeo.company.com@COMPANY).


### Windows ONLY

In Microsoft Active Directory, create a user (with "password does not expire" checked and "use must change password" unchecked) then, in a command-line window register the service principal name(s) you want this user to respond to (generally the server name in its short and fully qualified forms - note that again, it *has* to correspond to the server's canonical name in DNS):

setspn -a HTTP/servername@REALM <username>
setspn -a HTTP/fully.qualified.servername@REALM <username>

You can check the SPNs with:

setspn -l <username>

Then export the keytab with:

ktpass /out C:\temp\http.keytab /princ HTTP/servername@REALM /mapuser domain\username /pass password /crypto RC4-HMAC-NT /ptype KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL /kvno 0

(/mapuser and /pass should not be strictly necessary after setspn, but better be safe than sorry.)



### Generic

- Copy the keytab on your Nuxeo server

- Configure krb5.conf (/etc/krb5.conf or C:\Windows\krb5.ini, depending on the OS)

Note that on Linux servers, while it is not strictly necessary, you should really install the MIT Kerberos user tools (krb5-user in Debian-like). This will setup a basic krb5.conf and give you debugging tools.

This should contain, minimally:

    [libdefaults]
        default_realm	REALM

     [realms]
          REALM = {
               kdc = <kdc>
               admin_server = <admin_server>
          }

     [domain_realm]
          domain = REALM
          .domain = REALM

where <kdc> and <admin_server> are the names of your kdc and admin servers (duh). On Windows, both are your AD server. On Linux, kdc is where you've installed krb5-kdc and admin_server in where you've installed krb5-admin-server. Usually it's the same machine.
<domain> is the DNS domain you want to map to a realm. Since we'll always be specifying the realm it's not strictly necessary, but again, better be safe than sorry.
(it will be necessary in Linux clients though!)

On Linux servers, you can test your Kerberos installation with kinit -k -t /path/to/keytab HTTP/servername@REALM. There should be no errors and klist should list a krbtgt for your service. On my machine that looks like this:

     Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_1000
     Default principal: HTTP/loremipsum@LOREMIPSUM

     Valid starting     Expires            Service principal
     15/12/12 11:35:36  15/12/12 21:35:36  krbtgt/LOREMIPSUM@LOREMIPSUM
          renew until 16/12/12 11:35:36

Delete the tgt with kdestroy if you use your server as a Kerberos client too (eg it's a development machine!)

### Configure Java

To enable kerberos, you need to use a login configuration implementation. You have two ways of doing this. Either change the default Java configuration or use JAVA_OPTS. Take a look at [JAAS](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/jaas/JAASRefGuide.html#AppendixA) documentation for more details.

#### Change the default JRE configuration

in $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security find the login config url (it's commented out by default):

     #login.config.url.1=file:${user.home}/.java.login.config

set this to a regular file, e.g. /opt/nuxeo/java.login.config

#### Give a custom login file as Java argument

In _nuxeo.conf_, add the following line:

    JAVA_OPTS=$JAVA_OPTS -Djava.security.auth.login.config=/opt/nuxeo/java.login.config

Note that using one equal sign append or override parts of the default java.security file whereas using two equal sign completely override the default java.security file content.

    JAVA_OPTS=$JAVA_OPTS -Djava.security.auth.login.config==/opt/nuxeo/java.login.config


### Configure JAAS

open the java.login.config file you've setup and add the following configuration:

     Nuxeo {
        com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
        debug=true
        storeKey=true
        useKeyTab=true
        keyTab="/complete/path/to/keytab"
        principal="HTTP/servername@REALM";
     };

(Note that the login configuration MUST be called Nuxeo with an uppercase N!)


### Configure Nuxeo (we're almost there!)

deploy the bundle in $NUXEO_HOME/nxserver/bundles
create a $NUXEO_HOME/nxserver/config/kerberos-config.xml with the following:

     <?xml version="1.0"?>
     <component name="Kerberos-config">
             <require>org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.ui.web.auth.WebEngineConfig</require>
             <require>org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.ui.web.auth.defaultConfig</require>
             <require>org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.login.Kerberos</require>
             <documentation>
                     This Authentication Plugin uses Kerberos to assert user identity.
             </documentation>
             <extension target="org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.ui.web.auth.service.PluggableAuthenticationService"
                             point="authenticators">
                     <authenticationPlugin
                             name="KRB5_AUTH"
                             enabled="true"
                             class="org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.ui.web.auth.krb5.Krb5Authenticator">
                             <loginModulePlugin>Trusting_LM</loginModulePlugin>
                     </authenticationPlugin>
             </extension>

             <extension target="org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.ui.web.auth.service.PluggableAuthenticationService" point="chain">
                     <authenticationChain>
                             <plugins>
                                     <plugin>BASIC_AUTH</plugin>
                                     <plugin>KRB5_AUTH</plugin>
                                     <plugin>FORM_AUTH</plugin>
                             </plugins>
                     </authenticationChain>
             </extension>
     </component>

(Note: for now we assume all configuration - realm, kdc, server principal, etc. − lives in the server's standard configuration, i.e. either java.login.config or krb5.conf. An interesting update would be to make these configurable in Nuxeo.)


Start Nuxeo...





### Configure Client

If the client = IE or Chrome on a Windows computer that is an AD domain member, no further configuration should be necessary (just ensure your Nuxeo server is in the Local intranet or Trusted sites security zone).

If the client = Firefox on Windows (AD domain member), go to about:config, search for network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris and set it to your full server URL.

If the client = Firefox on Linux, in addition to the above, configure krb5.conf as above then get a Kerberos ticket with kinit <username>.

In the browser, type http://nuxeo_server:8080/nuxeo (NOT localhost but the server's canonical name! - that you mapped to the SPN!) and… you should be authenticated!




### Note

The authenticator supports a magic request header to disable it. Simply set the X-Skip-Kerberos request header and Nuxeo will move on to the next filter on the list. This is useful if you want integrated authentication from within a corporate network but not from outside: simply setup two Apache virtual hosts with an "internal" URL and an "external" URL. In the external virtual host, add the following directive:

RequestHeader set X-Skip-Kerberos true

and this will move on to form authentication.
