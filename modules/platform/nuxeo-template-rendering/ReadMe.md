## About Nuxeo Template Rendering
 The Nuxeo Template Rendering is a set of plugins that provides a way to associate a Nuxeo Document with a Template. The Templates are used to render the associated document. Depending on the Template type, a different Template Processor will be used and the resulting rendering can be :

   * an HTML document
   * an XML document
   * an OpenOffice document
   * an MS Office document


Each template processor has his own logic for rendering a Document from a Template :

   * raw processing (FreeMarker or XSLT)
   * merge fields replacement (MS Office / OpenOffice)

This project is an on-going project, supported by Nuxeo.

## Sub-modules organization
The project is splitted in several sub modules :

**nuxeo-template-rendering-api**
