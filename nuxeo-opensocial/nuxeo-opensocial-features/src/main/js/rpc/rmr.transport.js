 * For older WebKit-based browsers, the security model does not allow for any
 * known "native" hacks for conducting cross browser communication. However,
 * a variation of the IFPC (see below) can be used, entitled "RMR". RMR is
 * a technique that uses the resize event of the iframe to indicate that a
 * message was sent (instead of the much slower/performance heavy polling
 * technique used when a defined relay page is not avaliable). Simply put,
 * RMR uses the same "pass the message by the URL hash" trick that IFPC
 * uses to send a message, but instead of having an active relay page that
 * runs a piece of code when it is loaded, RMR merely changes the URL
 * of the relay page (which does not even have to exist on the domain)
 * and then notifies the other party by resizing the relay iframe. RMR
 * exploits the fact that iframes in the dom of page A can be resized
 * by page A while the onresize event will be fired in the DOM of page B,
 * thus providing a single bit channel indicating "message sent to you".
 * This method has the added benefit that the relay need not be active,
 * nor even exist: a 404 suffices just as well.
 *
 *   rmr: WebKit-specific resizing trick.
