[![Build Status](https://jenkins.platform.dev.nuxeo.com/buildStatus/icon?job=nuxeo/nuxeo/master)](https://jenkins.platform.dev.nuxeo.com/job/nuxeo/job/nuxeo/job/master/)

## About the Nuxeo Platform

The [Nuxeo Platform](http://www.nuxeo.com/products/content-management-platform/) is an open source customizable and extensible content management platform for building business applications. It provides the foundation for developing [document management](http://www.nuxeo.com/solutions/document-management/), [digital asset management](http://www.nuxeo.com/solutions/digital-asset-management/), [case management application](http://www.nuxeo.com/solutions/case-management/) and [knowledge management](http://www.nuxeo.com/solutions/advanced-knowledge-base/). You can easily add features using ready-to-use addons or by extending the platform using its extension point system.

The Nuxeo Platform is developed and supported by Nuxeo, with contributions from the community.

## Installation

Please follow the [Installation](https://doc.nuxeo.com/n/b1j) guide.

Running the Nuxeo Platform requires JDK 11, Oracle's JDK or OpenJDK.

Depending on the features you want to use, you may need some third-party software, such as LibreOffice and pdftohtml for document preview or ImageMagick for pictures. The list of third-party software is available in our Admin documentation: [Installing and Setting Up Related Software](https://doc.nuxeo.com/n/Yki).

## Building

Building the Nuxeo Platform requires the following tools:

- Git (obviously)
- JDK 11 (Oracle's JDK or OpenJDK recommended)
- Apache Maven 3.1.1+ (3.2+ recommended)
- Apache Ant 1.7.1+

Get the source code:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:nuxeo/nuxeo.git
cd nuxeo
```

Export the relevant options for the JVM running Maven:

```shell
export MAVEN_OPTS='-Xmx4g -Xms2g -XX:+TieredCompilation -XX:TieredStopAtLevel=1'
```

To build everything, including the packages, server ZIP and Docker image, run:

```shell
mvn install -Pdistrib,docker -DskipTests -Dnuxeo.skip.enforcer=true -T6
```

To take the shortest path for building the Docker image, run the following command. It starts by building the Docker image's dependencies (server modules and ZIP), then the Docker image itself.

```shell
mvn install -Pdistrib,docker -pl docker -am -DskipTests -Dnuxeo.skip.enforcer=true -T6
```

See the [docker](docker) directory for more information on how to build, run and configure the Nuxeo Docker Image.

See our [Nuxeo Core Developer Guide](https://doc.nuxeo.com/n/9ib) for complete instructions and guidelines.
